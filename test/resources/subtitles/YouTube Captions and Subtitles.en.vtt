[Herb, YouTuber]
This video demonstrates closed captions.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.000
To turn on captions, click on the icon over here.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.400
[Greg, Deaf Singer]
Back when the Internet was first established, deaf people had a
great time with it.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
Everything was readable.
Then ...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.200
[Ken, Deaf Listener]
Movies started showing up.
We couldn't understand them...

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
there were no captions!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
Fortunately, Google Video added support for captions.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Thank you, Ken!

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Now, we've added that to YouTube.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But the first thing he did with
that was RickRoll me!

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.000
[Franck, Icone de Mode]
Captions and subtitles are also helpful

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.200
for people who speak other languages, like myself.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000
With subtitles, I can enjoy US Comedy, or news stories from Russia,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500
in my own language. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
As a video uploader, this means you can reach
to people all over the world, 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.500
irrespective of language.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
[Hiroto, Bedhead]
You can upload multiple tracks like English and French, 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000
and viewers can choose the track they like.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500
[Toliver, Japanese Learner]
For example, if you enjoy using YouTube in French,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
French captions will automatically appear.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
With just a single video,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you can now reach people all around the globe!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The captioning capability at YouTube was just launched this summer,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.000
and we're planning to add more features to this.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.500
